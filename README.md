# Run the web version locally

This project is unlikely to be deployed, everything will happen locally. To run the website:

1. `npm install` to install all front end dependencies (make sure you have `npm` installed, this project uses the newest node version `v20.17.0`)
2. Load the `pom.xml` to install all back end dependencies
3. `npm run watch` to build all static assets
4. Run the `WebServer.java` script in `src/main/java/app`
4. navigate to `http://localhost:8080/signup` to start (sign up first!)
